☁️ Cloud Security & Deception Platform

A practical cloud security platform built to detect real attacker behavior, not just misconfigurations on a dashboard.

This project intentionally deploys high-risk cloud assets and deceptive services to observe how attackers discover, exploit, and move through cloud environments — turning attacker curiosity into defender intelligence.

⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is intended strictly for educational and defensive security research.
All testing is performed in controlled, self-owned cloud environments.
